[coursier](https://github.com/coursier/coursier) is library, an sbt plugin,
and a CLI tool, to manage and fetch libraries, and run applications from
Maven and Ivy repositories. A large number of applications now rely on it
to fetch dependencies, from [scalafmt](https://github.com/scalameta/scalafmt)
to [scastie](https://github.com/scalacenter/scastie),
[sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt),
[scalafiddle](https://scalafiddle.io),
[Ammonite](https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite),
 or VS Code language servers
([vscode-scala](https://github.com/dragos/dragos-vscode-scala),
[metals](https://github.com/scalameta/metals), and
[vscode-dotty](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/tree/master/vscode-dotty)).
