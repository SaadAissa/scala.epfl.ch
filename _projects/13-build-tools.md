description: "Contributions to Zinc, Scala's incremental compiler, and sbt."
---

This initiative focuses on improving day-to-day tools that all Scala developers depend on: [Zinc](https://github.com/sbt/zinc) (Scala's incremental compiler) and [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt), the most prominent Scala build tool.

Our involvement in these projects have helped them to improve on the following topics:
1. Reproducibility.
2. Performance.
3. Usability.
4. Documentation.
5. Welcoming experience to OSS developers.
<hr>

These contributions started off after the "[Improve builds with direct dependencies](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/009-improve-direct-dependency-experience.md)" proposal was finished before the estimated end time.
