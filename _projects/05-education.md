Our mission is to develop quality and widely accessible educational materials,
and to make them freely available. We have launched 5 courses along with a
capstone project. All courses can be taken for free (without a
certificate).

- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
- [Functional Program Design in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2)
- [Parallel Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1)
- [Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data)
- [Functional Programming in Scala Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-capstone).
- [Programming Reactive Systems](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-reactive-systems-3)
- Effective Programming in Scala (work in progress)

We have also created a [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/scala_tutorial/terms_and_types)
interactive tutorial that is based off of our above MOOCs. Walk through the
material of the functional programming in Scala MOOCs as an interactive
tutorial!
